            Imax (mm): is the maximum amount of interception, under the assumption that all interception evaporates

            Ce(−): is a parameter used to describe what factor actually evaporates from the ground
                  (Unsaturated root zone: 𝑆𝑢) and is 𝐸𝐴=𝑆𝑢𝑆𝑢,𝑚𝑎𝑥×𝐶𝑒𝐸𝑝

            Sumax(mm): Is the size of the reservoir of the unsaturated root zone (𝑆𝑢)
                    i.e. the amount of water the top layer of soil can hold. This parameter is used in a few other calculations.

            Beta (−): is a factor controlling the split between fast and slow flow (overland vs groundwater).
                    Some water will be held by the soil whilst some flows over it and straight to the river.
                    𝐶𝑟=(𝑆𝑢/𝑆𝑢_𝑚𝑎𝑥)^𝛽 which is used to determine the water infiltrating: 𝑄𝑖𝑢=(1−𝐶𝑟)𝑃𝑒
                    where 𝑃𝑒 is the actual precipitation reaching the ground.
                    The rest flow into the fast reservoir 𝑄𝑢𝑓 – which is the groundwater.

            Pmax (mm): is the maximum amount of percolation which can occur from the ground
                       to the deeper groundwater flow: 𝑄𝑢𝑠=𝑃𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑆𝑢𝑆𝑢,𝑚𝑎𝑥)

            T_lag (d): is the lag time between water falling and reaching the river.

            Kf (-): the fast flow is modelled as a linear reservoir thus a fraction
                    of the volume stored leaves to the river 𝑄𝑓=𝐾𝑓∗𝑆𝑓

            Ks (−): Similarly the slow flow is also modelled as 𝑄𝑆=𝐾𝑠∗𝑆𝑆.
